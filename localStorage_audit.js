// Comprehensive list of localStorage usage in the codebase
// This file maps all instances where localStorage is used for critical data

/*
AUDIT RESULTS:

1. AI Products Page (ai_products.js):
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('token') for authentication
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('userData') for user balances
   - Updates localStorage.setItem('userData') after purchases
   - Issue: Relies on localStorage for balance display and updates

2. Feeling Lucky Page (feeling_lucky.js):
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('token') for authentication
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('userData') for user data
   - Updates localStorage.setItem('userData') after wins
   - Issue: While it does fetch from API, it still updates and reads from localStorage

3. Asset Center Page (asset_center.js):
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('token') for authentication
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('userData') for balances
   - Updates localStorage.setItem('userData') after fetching
   - Issue: Relies on localStorage for balance display

4. Global Balance Component (global_balance.js):
   - Uses localStorage.getItem('token') for authentication
   - Fetches from API but doesn't properly update the UI
   - Issue: Not consistently working across pages

5. Other Pages:
   - my_team.js: Uses localStorage for user data
   - transactions.js: Uses localStorage for token
   - ubt_exchange.js: Uses localStorage for user data and balances
   - Various crypto assignment scripts: Use localStorage for non-critical data

REFACTOR PLAN:

1. Create centralized auth_utils.js module (DONE)
   - Standardize all user data and balance operations
   - Keep token in localStorage but fetch all other data from backend

2. Refactor each page to use auth_utils.js:
   - Replace all direct localStorage.getItem('userData') calls
   - Ensure all balance displays use live API data
   - Remove redundant balance update logic

3. Fix global balance component:
   - Ensure it's properly initialized on all pages
   - Make it use the centralized auth_utils.js module
   - Test across multiple pages

4. Validate all changes:
   - Test purchase flow
   - Test balance display consistency
   - Ensure no localStorage is used for critical data

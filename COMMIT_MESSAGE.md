# HSIT App Crypto Deposit Address Assignment Fix

## Summary of Changes
This commit resolves the "crypto deposit address assignment issue" by implementing a robust, database-driven solution that eliminates all CSV file dependencies. The changes ensure that cryptocurrency addresses are properly assigned to users, preventing duplicate assignments and ensuring data consistency.

## Key Improvements
1. Removed all CSV file dependencies from backend and frontend
2. Implemented fully database-driven address assignment logic
3. Added transaction support for atomic operations to prevent race conditions
4. Enhanced error handling and logging for better troubleshooting
5. Fixed import/export compatibility issues in migration scripts
6. Validated database consistency and address assignments
7. Removed all used.csv files and legacy CSV references

## Technical Details
- Backend routes and services now exclusively use MongoDB for address management
- Frontend scripts fetch addresses via API calls instead of client-side CSV processing
- Migration scripts ensure proper database state and fix any inconsistencies
- Validation confirms no duplicate assignments or orphaned records exist

## Files Changed
- Backend routes: users.js, crypto.js
- Backend services: AddressService.js, CryptoAddressService.js
- Backend scripts: setupAddresses.js, migrate-addresses.js, fixDuplicateAddresses.js, verify-addresses.js

- Removed: all used.csv files

## Testing
- Verified all users have proper address assignments in database
- Tested address assignment for new user registration
- Confirmed deposit address display functionality works correctly
- Ensured no references to deleted CSV files remain

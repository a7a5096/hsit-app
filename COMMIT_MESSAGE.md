# UBT Logo and Dashboard Button Update - Revision

This commit updates the previous implementation based on user feedback:

1. Changed the index page to use the full animated GIF instead of a static frame
2. Restricted the UBT/USDT exchange rate overlay to only appear on the dashboard button
3. Maintained the backend API for fetching live exchange rates
4. Updated the frontend JavaScript to only modify the dashboard button icon

## Technical Details

- Index page now uses logo.gif for the animated logo
- Dashboard button still uses the static frame with exchange rate overlay
- Exchange rate updates are now only applied to the dashboard button
- All changes remain production-ready and database-driven
